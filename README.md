# 2: Problems solved by GraphQL
GraphQL can solve problems which REST have.
One is over-fetch.
When I had to use Rest for fetching.
Even though, I needed few information, I should've fetched over information.
GraphQL gonna solve this over-fetching problem.
Other is under-fetch.
I don't know how to solve these problmes yet.
