# 2: Problems solved by GraphQL

GraphQL can solve problems which REST have.
One is over-fetch.
When I had to use Rest for fetching.
Even though, I needed few information, I should've fetched over information.
GraphQL gonna solve this over-fetching problem.
Other is under-fetch.
I don't know how to solve these problmes yet.

GraphQl Yoga is like react-create-app.
It's gonna make GraphQL server easily.
Also I installed babel-cli and set up this.
Don't know so far what this is going to be used.
